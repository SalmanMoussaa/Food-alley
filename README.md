###  Food Alley is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the React Native For the front-end .React-native is a cross-platform hybrid app development platform which allows us to use a single codebase for apps on mobile(Android, ios).
- this project uses ReactJs to creat the admin Website. ReactJS is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. It allows developers to create interactive and reusable UI components. ReactJS follows a component-based architecture, making it easier to manage and update different parts of an application independently. It efficiently renders and updates components, resulting in fast and responsive user experiences.
- this project uses Laravel to handle all the back-end of the app. Laravel is a PHP framework for web development, following MVC pattern. It offers efficient tools, a rich ecosystem, and promotes clean code for scalable applications.
  - this project uses MySQL for the Database mangment. MySQL is an open-source RDBMS for storing and managing structured data. It supports ACID transactions, multiple storage engines, and is widely used in web applications and CMS.
  - this project uses openai api to generate Mood Test question and to give suggested food based on the answer.
